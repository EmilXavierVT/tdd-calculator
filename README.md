This is a simple Calculator class written in Java to demonstrate Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles.
The class provides basic arithmetic operations and supports different input types.

## ✨ Features

add(int a, int b) → adds two integers

subtract(int a, int b) → subtracts one integer from another

multiply(int a, int b) → multiplies two integers

divide(int a, int b) → divides one integer by another

add(String numbers) → parses a comma-separated string of integers and returns their sum

add(int[] numbers) → sums up all integers in an array
